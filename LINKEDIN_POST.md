## Option 1: Technical Focus 🚀

🎥 Just deployed my full-stack Video Call Application!

Built a real-time video calling platform with:

- 🔐 JWT Authentication & User Onboarding
- 📹 High-quality video/audio calls powered by Stream.io
- 💬 Integrated chat functionality
- 👥 Friend request system
- 🎨 Multiple theme support with DaisyUI
- ⚡ Real-time notifications

**Tech Stack:**
Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Zustand
Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
Video/Chat: Stream.io SDK
Deployment: Vercel

The biggest challenge? Implementing cross-domain cookie authentication for secure sessions across frontend and backend. Solved it with sameSite="none" cookies and proper CORS configuration.

## Option 2: Impact Focus 🌟

💡 Built something I'm proud of - A full-stack Video Call Platform!

Ever wondered how apps like Zoom or Google Meet work behind the scenes? I dove deep into real-time communication technology and built my own version from scratch!

✨ Features:
• Secure user authentication
• HD video & audio calls
• Real-time messaging
• Friend connection system
• Beautiful, responsive UI with multiple themes

🎯 What I learned:

- Real-time video streaming with WebRTC
- Building scalable authentication systems
- Managing state in complex React applications
- Deploying full-stack apps to production

This project pushed me to understand how modern communication tools work at a deeper level. From database design to real-time streams, every layer was a learning experience!

Open to feedback and collaboration opportunities! 💼

## Option 3: Story Format 📖

🎬 From Idea to Deployment: Building a Video Call App

Three weeks ago, I started with a simple question: "Can I build a video calling platform?"

Here's what happened:

**Week 1:** Set up authentication, user profiles, and friend system
**Week 2:** Integrated Stream.io for video calls and real-time chat
**Week 3:** Polished UI, fixed cross-domain issues, deployed to production

🔧 Technical Highlights:

- React + Node.js full-stack architecture
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Stream.io SDK for video/chat infrastructure
- JWT-based secure authentication
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS

💪 Biggest Challenge:
Getting cookies to work across different domains in production. Spent hours debugging before discovering sameSite cookie attributes!

🎉 Result:
A fully functional video calling platform deployed on Vercel!
